> This Project is currently in early development and is not yet ready for production use. The core server functionality is being built, but many features are still in progress. Stay tuned for updates!

## 📖 Overview

PolyCore is a lightweight, real-time multiplayer Tetris server built with Java and WebSockets. It allows multiple players to connect, create or join game rooms, and compete against each other in classic Tetris gameplay.

### ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Real-time Multiplayer** - Play Tetris with friends in real-time
- 🏠 **Room System** - Create and join game rooms with configurable player limits
- 💬 **In-game Chat** - Communicate with other players via chat
- 🔧 **Command System** - Execute commands via chat (prefix with `/`)
- ⚙️ **Configurable** - Flexible YAML-based configuration
- 🔌 **Extensible Packet System** - Easy-to-extend annotation-based packet handling
- 🎮 **Full Tetris Mechanics** - Rotation, hold piece, hard drop, line clearing, and more

### Clients
#### Currently, there is only one very basic example client (Written with Github Co-Pilot)
#### However, you can create your own client using any WebSocket library that follows the packet structure defined in the documentation below.
#### I do plan on creating a simple web-based client in the future (or even a Java-based one), as soon as the Server is working as intended.

- [Example Client](https://github.com/JoshiCodes/PolyCore/tree/master/clients/example/)
  * A very simple example Client written in HTML and JavaScript, which can be used as a base for your own client or just to test the server functionality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

#### TODO

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

On first run, a `config.yml` file will be created. Here are the available options:

```yaml
application:
  host: 0.0.0.0       # Bind address (0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
  port: 3091          # Server port

# Some other settings
# which will not work yet, but will be implemented in the future.
```

---

## 📡 WebSocket API

### Connection

Connect to the server via WebSocket:
```
ws://<host>:<port>/tetris/game
```

### Packet Format

All packets follow this JSON structure:
```json
{
  "type": "PACKET_TYPE",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```
